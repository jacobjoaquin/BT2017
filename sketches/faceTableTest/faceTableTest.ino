Required Connections
--------------------
pin 2:  LED Strip #0    OctoWS2811 drives 8 LED Strips.
pin 14: LED strip #1    All 8 are the same length.
pin 7:  LED strip #2
pin 8:  LED strip #3    A 100 ohm resistor should used
pin 6:  LED strip #4    between each Teensy pin and the
pin 20: LED strip #5    wire to the LED strip, to minimize
pin 21: LED strip #6    high frequency ringining & noise.
pin 5:  LED strip #7
pin 15 & 16 - Connect together, but do not use
pin 4 - Do not use
pin 3 - Do not use as PWM.  Normal use is ok.

This test is useful for checking if your LED strips work, and which
color config (WS2811_RGB, WS2811_GRB, etc) they require.
